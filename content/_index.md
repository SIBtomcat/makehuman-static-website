# MakeHuman Community

This is a work in progress for porting the old website infrastructure to a more cohesive and updated solution.

The official site is still at http://www.makehumancommunity.org/ and will probably remain so for quite a while.

## Editing these pages

The sources for the site are MarkDown files with some extra markup for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and can be found on 
[GitHub](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman-static-website) (if you have access to it, it's private for now).

See the README.md file there for info on how to use Hugo.
