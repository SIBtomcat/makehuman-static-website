To download the Tools, navigate to [plugins page](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/plugins.html)
Download MakeClothes 2 at least. 

With version MakeHuman Version 1.2.0, best is to also download MakeSkin and MakeHuman plugin for blender. 
(for MakeHuman plugin for blender, the MakeHuman plugins MHAPI and Socket are needed)

The documentation of new MakeClothes is still under construction: [[Documentation:ClothesV2]].
There will be some additional information about techniques is near future.

As long as these are not available, there are also some useful hints in the old documentation, that can be found from the [documentation index](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/wiki/Documentation:Collection_of_old_documents).

Otherwise, following the video tutorials at [[Video:Blender_tools]] will probably be the best bet to get up to speed.
