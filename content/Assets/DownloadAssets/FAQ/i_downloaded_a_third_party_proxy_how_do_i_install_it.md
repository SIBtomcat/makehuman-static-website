Whole human proxies or proxymeshes are now called "topologies" on the MakeHuman tabs.  Like other third party assets (e.g., clothes, body parts, or targets), topologies are installed in the appropriate data-folder in the home directory. 

Example paths to the topology parent folder would be:

* Windows: "Documents\makehuman\v1py3\data\proxymeshes" on Windows Vista/7/8/10"  or MY DOCUMENTS\makehuman\v1py3\data\proxymeshes" on earlier Windows
* Linux:    \~/makehuman/v1/data/proxymeshes or \~/Documents/makehuman/v1py3/data/proxymeshed (depending on linux distribution).

Best practice is to create a new subfolder within the proxymeshes folder. The name of this folder should be the same as the proxy to be installed. Then copy the three files, e.g. proxy_name.proxy, proxy_name.obj and proxy_name.thumb, to the newly created subfolder.
