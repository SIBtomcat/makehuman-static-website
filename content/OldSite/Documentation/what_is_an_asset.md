title: "What is an asset?"

MakeHuman conceptually consist of two parts: Code (the program as such) and graphical assets.

An asset is generally anything that is visible on or in regards to the human model, for example:

* Target: A body morph, in practice a slider you drag inside the MakeHuman GUI
* Clothes: Various clothing you hang on the toon
* Hair: Hairstyles
* Skin: Textures you apply to the body
* Pose: A pose (for example "Sitting") you can put the toon in

There are more asset types than these, but they are the most obvious ones.
