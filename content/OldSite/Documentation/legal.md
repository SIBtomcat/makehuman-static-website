### Copyright and primary legal contact

In spring 2016, the copyright of the code files and the assets were consolidated and standardized. Some members of the core dev team explicitly asked to ''not'' be assigned any copyright or responsibility for the code. After this, most of what now constitutes MakeHuman is jointly copyrighted by the remaining members of the team. See the headers of the individual code or asset files for more details.

While doing this, copyright was also assigned to [Data Collection AB](https://www.datacollection.se) (which is a limited liability company owned by Joel Palmius), and this company was given the responsibility of working
as primary legal contact for MakeHuman.
