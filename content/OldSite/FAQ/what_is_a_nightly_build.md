title: "What is a nightly build?"
draft: false
---

A nightly build  is a build that reflects the current state of the source code. Each night a script runs and creates an executable including the latest changes.
This is a great way to preview the latest improvements we're making and to test fixes to bugs that have been checked-in between releases.

If you're downloading a nightly please don't expect things to work 100%. We make them available to you so you can try things out and report any bugs that you find. This process helps us ensure our final releases are the best they can be.

Nightly builds can be found at: http://download.tuxfamily.org/makehuman/nightly/

## Current status

Long-time users will remember a time when the nightly builds were actually more stable and complete than the latest stable. This is not the case now. 

The current set of nighly builds reflect a new branch for MakeHuman: the python3 port (see source at https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman). This is very much a work in progress and can be expected to be glitchy.
