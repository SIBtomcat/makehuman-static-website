The MakeHuman Plugin for Blender is a plugin which enables direct communication with MakeHuman from Blender. The main feature is that you get a one click import button that fetches the current character as displayed in MakeHuman into Blender, without the need to first export to a file. The import will handle rigging, proxies, clothes and materials.

Other features include:

* Automatic support for both Eevee and Cycles (the old Blender Internal renderer is not supported)
* Ability to switch between FK and IK
* Adds convencience modifiers for showing/hiding helper geometry
* Able to add enhanced skin shading with, for example, SSS
* Kinect integration

The blender plugin is available for download from the [plugins page](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/plugins.html) and is bundled in the makehuman download for windows.

For instructions on how to install it, see [[FAQ: How do I install a plugin in Blender 2.80?]]

Not that for the import from MakeHuman to work, you also need to enable the socket server on the community->socket tab in MH.
