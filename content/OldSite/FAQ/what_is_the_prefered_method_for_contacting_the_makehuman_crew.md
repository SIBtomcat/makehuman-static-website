If you have questions, the forums are the default choice. **ALL SUPPORT REQUESTS SHOULD GO VIA THE [FORUMS](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/)**. We have had to stop posting our email addresses because of the huge load of incoming support requests, so please don't try to contact us directly. This includes facebook: chances are we won't even answer facebook direct messages. 

Bug reports should go to http://bugtracker.makehumancommunity.org.

If you want to chat directly with someone from the MakeHuman crew, there is an IRC channel, see [[FAQ:Is there an IRC channel?]], but it is only infrequently visited by someone from the dev team.

And oh, before trying to contact anyone at all, please read all relevant parts of http://www.makehumancommunity.org/wiki/FAQ:Index
