Yes, see http://www.makehumancommunity.org/wiki/Releases:120mac

There is also an old mac build for 1.1.1, available for download via the [download page](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/downloads.html). This should compatible with older releases of OSX. 

It is also possible run from source on mac (see instructions in https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman/blob/master/README.md), through using largely the same approach as on Windows.
