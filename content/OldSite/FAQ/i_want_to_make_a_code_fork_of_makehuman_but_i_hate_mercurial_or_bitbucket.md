Source snapshots of stable releases are mirrored to git on github. See https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman_release. 

If you want to follow the development branch (what becomes nightly builds) you will have to put up with the mercurial repo though. Or download source zips and commit them to a repo of your own.
