title: "What's with the \"makehuman-community-*\" file name?"
draft: false
---

The nightly builds bundle more than just makehuman. They include (at least):

* MHX2
* MHAPI
* The asset downloader

More extras might be included at a later time. 

The name is picked to reflect a focus on integration with the community site and the community assets. 

The final release will also be named "makehuman community" rather than just "makehuman".
