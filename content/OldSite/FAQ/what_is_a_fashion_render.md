The [fashion render](http://www.makehumancommunity.org) is a standardized scene with fixed camera and light. The image depicts one toon in a standing position, although possibly from various angles. 

The intention with the renders is that a user should be able to get a completely honest idea about how an asset looks immediately after being imported into blender (usually via MHX). 

Thus there are strict rules limiting what can and can't be done with the toons post import. For example, the materials can not be modified, and the meshes cannot (with a few exceptions) be edited.
