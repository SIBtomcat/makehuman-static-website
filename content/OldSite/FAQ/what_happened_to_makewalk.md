MakeWalk has been marked as deprecated by its author Thomas Larsson. The recommended replacement is BVH Retargeter from https://diffeomorphic.blogspot.com/p/bvh-retargeter.html

Note that the MH dev group isn't involved in either product and thus cannot answer any questions regarding bugs or development for these.
