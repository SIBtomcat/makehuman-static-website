MakeHuman-related plugins for blender usually come as zip files. These can be imported into blender directly without the need to first unzip them. 

* In blender, go to the menu edit -> preferences
* Go to the "Add-ons" tab
* Click the "Install..." button
* Browse to the zip file containing the addon and select it
* Click "Install addon from file"
* (the addon should appear in the main window)
* Make sure you enable the addon by checking its checkbox. It will be disabled per default.
* In the bottom left of the window, click the menu icon (three horizontal bars)
* Click "save preferences"
