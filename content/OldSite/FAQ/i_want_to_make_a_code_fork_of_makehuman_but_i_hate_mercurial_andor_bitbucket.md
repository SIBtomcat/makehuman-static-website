Source snapshots of stable releases are mirrored to git on github. See https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman_release.

If you want to follow the development branch (what becomes nightly builds), you'll have to put up with the current mercurial repo though. Or download a source snapshot and commit it to a new repo of your own.
