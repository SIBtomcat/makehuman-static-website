Starting summer 2015, we are opening up contribution areas for user-created content. These areas can be found here: http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/user_contributed_assets.html

If you have an asset that you want to contribute, simply click the link, find the right section and follow the instructions. 

For other assets which do not fit anywhere in the areas, your best bet is to post a zip on the forums. Or wait a bit until we open a relevant repository for it.
