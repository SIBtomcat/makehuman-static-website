The MakeHuman project has a multitude of channels where content is published. Most of these are not monitored for comments. 

The channels which ''are'' monitored are:

* The forum
* The bugtracker(s)

Thus, if you want your report to be seen by someone who is able to answer, your best bet is using one of these. If you have a support request, your best bet is [the forum]. If you have a bug report, take a look at [http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/bugtracker.html the bug tracker(s)](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/forum/)

## What to include in a bug report or support request

Unless it is obvious from the context or otherwise irrelevant, it will generally make things easier if you provide this information:

* Exactly which version of makehuman are you using? As in, which binary did you download and from where?
* What operating system are you using? Preferably with the OS version, for example "windows 10 64-bit" or "ubuntu 18.04"
* What graphics card are you using?
* If there was a crash, include logs (see [[FAQ:How_to_provide_a_makehuman_log_for_a_good_bug_report%3F|How to provide a makehuman log]])

## Where to ''not'' ask for support 

The channels which are specifically ''not'' monitored are:

* Youtube comments
* Facebook comments
* Blendernation
* Blenderartists

Thus, if you post something there, you should not be surprised if you get no answer. Occasionally someone might see something posted here and answer it, but this is on a random basis.
