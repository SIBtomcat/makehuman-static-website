If you want to get the latest version of a plugin, you can go to the appropriate github page and download it as a zip file. 

* For MPFB, download the latest zip here: https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman-plugin-for-blender/tree/master/blender_distribution
* For most other makehuman-related blender plugins, go to the github repo, click "clone or download" and then "download as zip". 

With the zip file available, you can upgrade the addon inside blender. 

* Approach 1: Go to edit -> preferences -> addons. Find the plugin. Expand it. Click remove. Then follow the instructions in [[FAQ: How do I install a plugin in Blender 2.80?]]
* Approach 2: Follow the instructions in [[FAQ: How do I install a plugin in Blender 2.80?]] directly, but make sure you check the "overwrite" checkbox when importing the plugin

In either approach, you may need to restart blender before the new version of the plugin works.
