## MH 1.1 (stable)


Contrary to popular opinion it is not all that difficult to run MakeHuman directly from source. Doing so has the following benefits:

* You get full access to all assets (i.e. you are not restricted to only compiled/processed/compressed versions)
* You can "update" the MakeHuman directory and thereby download only the latest changes instead of having to download and unzip a big binary each time a change has been made. (This requires the usage of Mercurial)

MakeHuman code is pure Python based. To run MakeHuman from source you need to install the following dependencies: Python 2.7, NumPy, PyOpenGl and PyQt for Qt4. The link to the source code is in the download section. You can either get the code as a zip-file or download it with the version control tool Mercurial.

The full procedure with platform specific notes is documented in [[Documentation:Running_MakeHuman_from_source|Running MakeHuman from Source]].

## MH 1.2 (unstable)


If you're looking for the source code of the upcoming MakeHuman 1.2.0 go to [https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman](https://github.com/makehumancommunity/makehuman). You'll also find basic instructions on how to get started on this page.
