title: "Why is there no perspective mode?"
draft: false
---

In a professional pipeline, there are two phases:

# Modeling the character.
# Using the character.

While the perspective is fundamental in the step two, it's not needed in phase one.

In phase one it's even harmful, since it generates huge deformations and the perception of the resulting character is highly subjective (see image below).

A character modelled with a focal length can appear very ugly and unnatural when viewed with a different perspective.

For this reason perspective is not used by professionals during this phase. Since MakeHuman is designed for phase one, it will only have the ortho view.
