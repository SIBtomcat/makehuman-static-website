title: "We at company X don't like AGPL and want another license"
draft: false

The MH devs frequently get requests sent to their personal mailboxes, asking for exceptions from the AGPL license. 

The usual gist of these mails is that a company wants to profit from the MH codebase or the morph database by taking large parts of them and include them in their commercial software, but that they are unable to do so because of the AGPL license. They therefore want an exception from AGPL, for example a commercial license.

At this point in time there are no plans to grant such exceptions. MakeHuman is an non-commercial open source project, and the plan is to remain that way.
