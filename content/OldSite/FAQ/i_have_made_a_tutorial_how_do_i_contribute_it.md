If it is a video tutorial, simply paste it in the appropriate section under [[Video:Index]]. Any user with a forum login can also login on the wiki and edit the pages there.

To insert a a video, use the special markup that looks like this

  <nowiki>{{#ev:youtube|X13k7H3dNHo}}</nowiki>

The parts are "#ev" (which you always write), "youtube", which can be "vimeo" or a number of other video services, and "X13k7H3dNHo" which is the ID on the video on the service (for vimeo this is a number). You can usually find this in the address field of the browser when viewing the video.

If it is a text tutorial, convert it to wiki by editing the appropriate page under [[Documentation:Index]].
