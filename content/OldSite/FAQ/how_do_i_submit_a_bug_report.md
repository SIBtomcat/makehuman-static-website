If you have found something that you think merits a bug report, please submit it on the bug tracker.

The credentials on the [bug tracker](http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/bugtracker.html) are the same as on the forums, so if you already have a forum login, use that to log in on the bug tracker.

NOTE: if you experienced a crash rather than a glitch, please also read this before submitting your bug report: [[FAQ:How to provide a makehuman log for a good bug report?]]
