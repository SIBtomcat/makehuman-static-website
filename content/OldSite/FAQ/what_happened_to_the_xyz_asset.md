The maintenance and addition of assets have been largely been deferred to the community repos, which can be found at http://www.makehumancommunity.org/content/user_contributed_assets.html. If there is something you would like to see there, you can petition the community on the forums in the hope someone will take the initiative to create the asset.

As a general policy, the base distribution will only contain a minimal number of sample assets.

"Asset" mentioned above being one of:

* Skin / texture / material
* Target
* Topology / proxy
* Rig / skeleton
* Clothes
* Hair
