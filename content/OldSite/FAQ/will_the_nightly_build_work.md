If you have a modern workstation with a discrete nVidia card (as opposed to, say, a laptop with an integrated intel graphics chip), it might. 

The binary starts and works on the build machine at least, but there are several reports about problems on other computers. 

In summary: Don't be surprised if you get a crash or a MakeHuman window where no toon is visible.
