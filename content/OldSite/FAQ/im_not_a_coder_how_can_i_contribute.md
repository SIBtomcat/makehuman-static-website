If you are an artist, consider making assets for MakeHuman and share them with the community. For more info, see [[FAQ:I have made a new asset for MakeHuman. How can I contribute it?]]

If you want to write documentation (something which is always needed), simply go ahead and edit the relevant page here on the wiki. For more info see [[FAQ:I have made a tutorial. How do I contribute it?]] and [[FAQ:I want to help write documentation. How do I do that?]]

Apart from this, testing and bug reporting is always needed, as well as answering questions on forums. If you want ideas, go to http://bugtracker.makehumancommunity.org and see what's in the queue.
